üìã Main branch protection rules now enforce:
  ‚úÖ Pull requests are required
  ‚úÖ At least 1 approving review required
  ‚úÖ Stale reviews are dismissed when new commits are pushed
  ‚úÖ Status checks must pass: CI tests (Python 3.11 & 3.12), security scan, build validation
  ‚úÖ Conversations must be resolved before merging
  ‚úÖ Force pushes are blocked
  ‚úÖ Branch deletion is blocked

üöÄ Next steps:
1. All future changes should be made on feature branches
2. Create pull requests to merge into main
3. Ensure all CI checks pass before merging
4. Get at least 1 approving review before merging

üìö Workflow example:
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   git commit -am 'Add new feature'
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   gh pr create --title 'Add new feature' --body 'Description of changes'
