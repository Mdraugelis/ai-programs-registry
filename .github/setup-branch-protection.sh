📋 Main branch protection rules now enforce:
  ✅ Pull requests are required
  ✅ At least 1 approving review required
  ✅ Stale reviews are dismissed when new commits are pushed
  ✅ Status checks must pass: CI tests (Python 3.11 & 3.12), security scan, build validation
  ✅ Conversations must be resolved before merging
  ✅ Force pushes are blocked
  ✅ Branch deletion is blocked
  
🔒 Direct commits to main branch are now blocked - all changes must go through pull requests!

🚀 Next steps:
1. All future changes should be made on feature branches
2. Create pull requests to merge into main
3. Ensure all CI checks pass before merging
4. Get at least 1 approving review before merging

📚 Workflow example:
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   git commit -am 'Add new feature'
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   gh pr create --title 'Add new feature' --body 'Description of changes'
